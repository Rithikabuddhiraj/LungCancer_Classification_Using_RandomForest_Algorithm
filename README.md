LungCancer\_Classification\_Using\_RandomForest\_Algorithm

This project presents a machine learning pipeline to classify lung cancer presence using the Random Forest algorithm. The solution leverages patient data and key medical attributes to train a supervised classification model that can aid in early detection and decision-making processes in the healthcare domain.

Project Objective:

To develop a predictive model that classifies whether a patient has lung cancer based on various health indicators using the Random Forest Classifier, ensuring high accuracy and interpretability.

Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Model**: RandomForestClassifier
* **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

What Was Done

* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and data quality.
* Performed data cleaning, handling missing values and preparing data for model training.
* Implemented a Random Forest classifier to predict lung cancer diagnosis.
* Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
* Visualized key metrics and feature importance to interpret model behavior.

Results

* Achieved **high classification accuracy** and good generalization performance.
* Identified **important features** contributing to cancer prediction using feature importance from Random Forest.
